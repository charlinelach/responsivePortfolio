# Responsive Portfolio
The initial purpose of this project is to test/provide practice for the developer in coding with CSS and Bootstrap.
<br>
The second motion of this application was to improve its input and provide professional materials (as if applying to developer roles) to recruiters. It provides links to great resources about the creator.
