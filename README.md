# Responsive Portfolio
The initial purpose of this project is to test/provide practice for the developer in coding with CSS and Bootstrap.
<br>
The third motion of this application was to improve its input, to provide professional materials (as if applying to developer roles), to supply contact information to recruiters. It provides links to great resources about the creator and many projects.
